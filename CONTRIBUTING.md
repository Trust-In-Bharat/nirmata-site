## Content Rules: Standards & Copyright
- Do **not** copy text from ISO/IEC, SOC 2, PCI DSS, NIST SPs, BIS publications, or other paid/licensed standards.
- OK: name the standard, version/year, clause numbers, and brief neutral paraphrases in your own words.
- Keep “Compliance Mapping” tables short: standard name + clause refs + generic note. No verbatim requirement language.
- If in doubt, paraphrase or link to the official site instead of quoting.
