# TRUST-IN Bharat  
### Powered by the NIRMATA Framework  
**(National Information Risk Maturity and Trust Assessment)**  

---

## 1. Vision and Purpose

**TRUST-IN Bharat** is India’s national self-assessment initiative for measuring and improving maturity in **data security**, **privacy**, and **AI governance**.  

It enables Indian organizations—especially MSMEs and manufacturing enterprises—to understand their current state, benchmark against global best practices, and progress toward **resilient, trusted, and compliant operations**.

At its core lies the **NIRMATA Framework** — the technical architecture of the programme — defining maturity levels, evidence criteria, and crosswalks with major laws and standards (DPDP Act, CERT-In Directions, ISO 27001/27701/42001, and NIST CSF).

---

## 2. The NIRMATA Framework

### Purpose
To establish a **nationally relevant, evidence-based maturity model** that can be used for self-evaluation, certification, and improvement across sectors.

### Guiding Principles
- **Trust by Design** — Build confidence in every process.  
- **Privacy by Design** — Protect personal data across its lifecycle.  
- **Resilience by Default** — Anticipate, absorb, and recover from incidents.

## 3. Maturity Levels

| Level | Label | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **0** | **Non-existent / Unaware** | No formal responsibility or control mechanisms. |
| **1** | **Initial / Reactive** | Isolated, ad-hoc responses; compliance only after incidents. |
| **2** | **Defined / Emerging** | Policies and roles established; limited implementation. |
| **3** | **Implemented / Managed** | Processes standardized, repeatable, and reviewed. |
| **4** | **Measured / Integrated** | Controls quantitatively monitored; data-driven management. |
| **5** | **Resilient / Trusted** | Continuous improvement, automation, and transparent governance. |
