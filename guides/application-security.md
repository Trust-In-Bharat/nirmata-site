> Status: **Preview skeleton**. Community contributions welcome.

## 1) Quick posture check (by level)
- **L0 → L1:** 3–5 “table-stakes” checks
- **L1 → L2:** baseline policy/process existence checks
- **L2 → L3:** defined ownership, metrics, and reviews
- **L3 → L4:** automation and continuous monitoring
- **L4 → L5:** resilience, adversary exercises, learn-improve loop

## 2) Evidence to collect
- Artifacts list (policies, logs, reports, tickets)
- Sampling guidance (how many, how recent)

## 3) Controls to reach the next level
- Minimal viable set
- Implementation tips for MSMEs vs larger orgs

## 4) Tools and low-cost options
- OSS and entry-level SaaS with notes
- Configuration hardening references

## 5) Metrics that matter
