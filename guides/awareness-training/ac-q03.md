> **Question:** Is onboarding training provided to new employees, contractors, and interns before granting system access?

# Why This Matters
Embedding security culture from day one reduces onboarding risk and ensures staff understand obligations before handling data.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No onboarding security training.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Awareness shared verbally by supervisors.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Formal onboarding module mandatory for new staff.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Completion tracked by HR before system access.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Content updated with latest threats and policy changes.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Gamified interactive onboarding with behavior metrics.</div>
