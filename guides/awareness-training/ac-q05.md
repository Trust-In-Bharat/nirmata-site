> **Question:** Is role-based security and privacy training delivered for key functions (e.g., IT, HR, Legal, Finance, Developers)?

# Why This Matters
Generic training alone is ineffective. Function-specific modules strengthen accountability where risk is concentrated.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No differentiation in training content.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Occasional deep-dives for IT only.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Role mapping performed; custom modules drafted.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Training assigned per role; completion tracked.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Curriculum linked to job description and risk profile.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Adaptive learning paths generated automatically by role data.</div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |Identify high-risk roles (IT, HR, Dev, Finance).|
| 1 → 2 |Draft custom modules for each function.|
| 2 → 3 |Assign courses in LMS with tracking.|
| 3 → 4 |Integrate training plan into HR onboarding.|
| 4 → 5 |Automate course assignment using role metadata.|

# Enablers
- **People:** CISO, HR Manager, Department Heads  
- **Process:** Identify → Design → Deliver → Track  
- **Technology:** LMS, HRMS integration  

# Evidence
- Role-to-training matrix  
- Completion reports by department  
- Updated content repository  

# KPIs
- Number of roles with specific training  
- Completion rate per function  
- Average quiz score improvement  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LMS | Moodle | Supports role-based courses |
| Tracking | Airtable | Custom role matrix |
| Automation | n8n | Assign courses from HR feed |

# Common Pitfalls
- Same content for all employees  
- No tracking of technical staff training  
- Modules never updated for new roles  

# Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO/IEC 27001 | 7.2 / 7.3 |
| DPDP Act 2023 | Sec 10 (Accountability and Training) |
