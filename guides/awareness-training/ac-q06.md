> **Question:** Are phishing or social-engineering simulations conducted to test staff vigilance?

# Why This Matters
Practical simulations turn abstract awareness into measurable behavior change and reveal weak spots in everyday practices.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No testing of user awareness.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Occasional manual phishing emails by IT.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Simulations scheduled quarterly with defined metrics.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Results fed back into targeted training modules.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Scenarios include vishing, smishing, and USB baiting.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated adaptive simulations based on user behavior. </div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |Run basic manual phishing test.|
| 1 → 2 |Schedule quarterly campaigns with metrics.|
| 2 → 3 |Use results to trigger micro-training.|
| 3 → 4 |Add multi-vector social engineering scenarios.|
| 4 → 5 |Automate adaptive testing per user risk score.|

# Enablers
- **People:** IT Security Team, Awareness Lead  
- **Process:** Plan → Simulate → Measure → Educate  
- **Technology:** Phishing-simulation platform, reporting dashboard  

# Evidence
- Simulation records  
- Click-rate metrics  
- Remediation training proof  

# KPIs
- Number of campaigns per year  
- Click rate trend (month-on-month)  
- Number of users who reported phish  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Simulation | GoPhish | Free open-source framework |
| Tracking | Airtable | Campaign logs |
| Training | Google Forms | Follow-up quiz |

# Common Pitfalls
- Public shaming of employees  
- No remedial training after failures  
- Testing too predictable  

# Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO/IEC 27001 | A.6.3 (User Responsibilities) |
| DPDP Act 2023 | Sec 10 (Accountability and Awareness) |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | PR.AT / DE.AE |
| NIRMATA Mapping | AC-Q06 builds behavioral resilience through testing. |
