> **Question:** Does the organization measure cultural maturity and behavioral indicators of security awareness?

# Why This Matters
Awareness without behavior change is ineffective. Cultural measurement turns perception into actionable data.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No measurement of culture or behavior.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Informal feedback from training sessions.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual surveys on awareness and attitude.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Behavioral KPIs collected (e.g., phish reporting rate). </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Metrics correlated with incident rates and policy violations. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous sentiment analysis and culture dashboards. </div>
</div>
