> **Question:** Is the awareness and culture program periodically reviewed for effectiveness and improvement?

# Why This Matters
A review cycle ensures the program evolves with new threats, business priorities, and user feedback.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No review or evaluation of program effectiveness.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Feedback collected informally after sessions.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual review meeting scheduled. </div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Metrics and survey results evaluated for improvement. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Review inputs from risk, HR, and incident functions. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated dashboards and continuous feedback loops. </div>
