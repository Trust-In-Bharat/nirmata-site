> **Question:** Has the organization defined a Business Continuity Management (BCM) policy, scope, and objectives?

# Why This Matters
A clear BCM policy ensures the organization can sustain critical operations during disruption and fulfil legal and contractual obligations.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No BCM policy or defined objectives.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Continuity activities informal and uncoordinated.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>BCM policy approved with scope and responsibilities.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Objectives mapped to critical functions and reviewed annually.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>BCM aligned with risk and incident programs.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous resilience governance with dashboards and KPIs.</div>
