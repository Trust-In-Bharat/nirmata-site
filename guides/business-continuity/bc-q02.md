> **Question:** Has a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) been conducted to identify critical activities, RTOs, and RPOs?

# Why This Matters
The BIA quantifies impact of disruptions and prioritizes resources for recovery planning.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No BIA performed.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Partial impact noted by functions.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>BIA template approved and executed for core departments.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>All critical processes have documented RTO/RPO.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>BIA results inform risk register and continuity plans.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated BIA updates linked to process changes.</div>

# How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |Identify critical processes and dependencies. |
| 1 → 2 |Develop and approve BIA template. |
| 2 → 3 |Complete BIA for all departments. |
| 3 → 4 |Map RTO/RPO to risk and recovery plans. |
| 4 → 5 |Integrate BIA with change management system. |

# Enablers
- **People:** BCM Coordinator, Department Leads  
- **Process:** Identify → Analyze → Validate  
- **Technology:** Survey tool, BCM database  

# Evidence
- Completed BIA reports  
- RTO/RPO register  
- Validation meeting records  

# KPIs
- Number of critical processes with defined RTO/RPO  
- Average recovery time target  
- Update frequency of BIA reports  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)
| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Templates | Google Sheets | Custom BIA form |
| Tracking | Airtable | Critical process register |
| Visualization | Metabase | Impact heatmap |

# Common Pitfalls
- RTO/RPO values not validated  
- Outdated BIA after org changes  
- Limited management involvement  

# Compliance Mapping
| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO 22301 | 8.2 (BIA) |
| ISO 27001 | A.5.30 |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | ID.BE / RS.RP |
| NIRMATA Mapping | BC-Q02 quantifies business impact for prioritized resilience. |
