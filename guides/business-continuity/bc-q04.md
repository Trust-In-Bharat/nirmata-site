> **Question:** Are Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) developed and maintained for all critical functions?

# Why This Matters
BCPs translate strategies into execution steps during disruption. They reduce confusion and enable rapid recovery.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No formal BCPs.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Plans exist for a few departments. </div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Standard template and owner assigned per plan. </div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Plans updated annually and tested. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Plans linked to BIA, IT DR, and communications. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Dynamic plans with workflow automation and real-time updates. </div>
</div>

# How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |Identify departments with no BCP. |
| 1 → 2 |Provide template and assign plan owners. |
| 2 → 3 |Test plans annually and record results. |
| 3 → 4 |Integrate plans with other resilience functions. |
| 4 → 5 |Enable real-time workflow updates. |

# Enablers
- **People:** Plan Owners, BCM Manager  
- **Process:** Develop → Test → Maintain  
- **Technology:** Document portal, workflow engine  

# Evidence
- Approved BCPs  
- Test records and review notes  
- Change log  

# KPIs
- Number of plans tested annually  
- Percentage updated within 12 months  
- Average test score vs criteria  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)
| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Templates | Google Docs | Reusable structure |
| Tracking | Airtable | Plan register |
| Testing | Metabase | Score dashboard |

# Common Pitfalls
- Plans never tested  
- Unclear roles during crisis  
- Documents stored inaccessible locations  

# Compliance Mapping
| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO 22301 | 8.4 (BCP development and implementation) |
| ISO 27001 | A.5.30 |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | RS.RP |
| NIRMATA Mapping | BC-Q04 operationalizes continuity through maintained plans. |
