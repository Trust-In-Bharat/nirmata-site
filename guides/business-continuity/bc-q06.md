> **Question:** Are crisis-management and communication plans defined, with clear roles and escalation paths?

# Why This Matters
During crises, structured communications reduce panic and maintain stakeholder trust. Defined roles enable swift decisions.

# Maturity

  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No defined crisis process or contacts.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Ad-hoc communications after incidents.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Crisis plan with command structure and contacts.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Regular updates and simulation drills conducted.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Aligned with PR, HR, and incident response playbooks.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Multi-channel alerting and decision dashboards.</div>
