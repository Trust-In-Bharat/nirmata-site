> **Question:** Are continuity and DR plans tested periodically through tabletop or full-scale exercises?

# Why This Matters
Testing validates that plans work under pressure and that teams understand their roles during a real disruption.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No testing conducted.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Tests performed informally and not documented.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual tabletop drills for key processes.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Full-scale or cross-functional tests with action plans.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Testing aligned to risk and incident framework. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous scenario simulation and digital exercises.</div>

# How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |Schedule a basic tabletop for critical processes.|
| 1 → 2 |Define test scope, criteria, and roles.|
| 2 → 3 |Conduct multi-team exercises and record lessons.|
| 3 → 4 |Integrate findings into risk and improvement plans.|
| 4 → 5 |Introduce digital simulations and continuous readiness. |

# Enablers
- **People:** BCM Manager, IT DR Lead, HR Safety Officer  
- **Process:** Plan → Test → Review → Improve  
- **Technology:** Exercise management tool, video recap  

# Evidence
- Test schedule and results  
- Action items and closures  
- Management review minutes  

# KPIs
- Number of tests conducted per year  
- Action closure rate (%)  
- Average test score improvement  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)
| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tracking | Airtable | Test register |
| Recording | OBS / Zoom | Exercise capture |
| Visualization | Metabase | Trend charts |

# Common Pitfalls
- Tests skipped due to workload  
- Findings not tracked to closure  
- No management review of results  

# Compliance Mapping
| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO 22301 | 8.5 / 9.1 |
| ISO 27001 | A.5.30 |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | RS.IM / GV.MA |
| NIRMATA Mapping | BC-Q07 validates continuity plans through structured testing. |
