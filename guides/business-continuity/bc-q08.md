> **Question:** Are lessons from incidents and tests tracked and incorporated into updated continuity and recovery plans?

# Why This Matters
Improvement loops convert experience into resilience. Without review, the same gaps reappear in future crises.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No post-incident review or lessons log.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Findings shared verbally without tracking.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Template for lessons learned and action log.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Actions assigned and tracked to closure.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Outputs feed risk register and training updates.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated trends and predictive insights shared quarterly.</div>
</div>

# How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |Record key lessons from past incidents.|
| 1 → 2 |Adopt standard template for lessons log.|
| 2 → 3 |Assign owners and due dates for actions.|
| 3 → 4 |Link to risk and training programs.|
| 4 → 5 |Automate trends and dashboards. |

# Enablers
- **People:** BCM Lead, Risk Manager, HR Training  
- **Process:** Capture → Assign → Implement → Review  
- **Technology:** Issue tracker, dashboard tool  

# Evidence
- Lessons-learned register  
- Closed actions list  
- Updated plans showing revisions  

# KPIs
- Number of actions closed per quarter  
- Repeat issues identified  
- Plan update frequency  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)
| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tracking | Airtable | Lessons register |
| Dashboards | Metabase | Trend analysis |
| Collab | Nextcloud | Versioned plans |

# Common Pitfalls
- Actions not tracked to closure  
- No linkage to training updates  
- Same issues repeat year to year  

# Compliance Mapping
| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO 22301 | 10.2 / 9.1 |
| ISO 27001 | A.10 (Improvement) |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | GV.MA / RS.IM |
| NIRMATA Mapping | BC-Q08 institutionalizes learning and resilience growth. |
