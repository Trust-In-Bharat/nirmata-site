> **Question:** Is there an alternate workspace or remote-work arrangement available for continuity during disruptions?

# Why This Matters
Continuity of people and workspace is as critical as IT recovery. Alternate locations or secure remote access prevent downtime when primary sites are unavailable.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No alternative workspace or policy.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Informal remote work during crises.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Designated alternate site or VPN-enabled remote access.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Workplace recovery tested annually.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Alternate workspace embedded in BCP drills and HR policy.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Resilient-by-design hybrid work model with secure access and monitoring.</div>

# How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |Enable ad hoc remote access for critical users. |
| 1 → 2 |Define alternate site or remote policy formally. |
| 2 → 3 |Conduct site/remote access test. |
| 3 → 4 |Integrate workspace recovery into BCP. |
| 4 → 5 |Adopt hybrid, secure-by-design continuity model. |

# Enablers
- **People:** Facilities Manager, IT Admin, HR  
- **Process:** Prepare → Validate → Integrate  
- **Technology:** VPN, endpoint security, collaboration suite  

# Evidence
- Workspace policy and access logs  
- Test reports or remote drill logs  
- BCP update reflecting recovery workspace  

# KPIs
- Number of users with secure remote access  
- Time to switch to alternate workspace  
- Frequency of continuity drills  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)
| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Collaboration | Nextcloud / Mattermost | Remote operations |
| VPN | WireGuard | Secure connectivity |
| Tracking | Airtable | Test logs and readiness checklist |

# Common Pitfalls
- VPN or remote access untested under load  
- Policy unclear on work-from-home security  
- Facilities dependency not reviewed  

# Compliance Mapping
| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO 22301 | 8.4.3 / 8.4.4 |
| ISO 27001 | A.5.30 |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | RS.RP / PR.AC |
| NIRMATA Mapping | BC-Q09 ensures workspace continuity and secure remote operations. |
