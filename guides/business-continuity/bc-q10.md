> **Question:** Are critical suppliers and partners included in business continuity and recovery planning?

# Why This Matters
Continuity depends on external partners as much as internal readiness. Engaging suppliers ensures end-to-end resilience.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No supplier continuity considerations.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Vendors contacted only during incidents.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Critical vendors identified with contact details. </div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Supplier continuity requirements added to contracts. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Joint recovery testing and BCP alignment performed. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous joint resilience monitoring and assurance. </div>
</div>

# How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |List critical suppliers for key processes. |
| 1 → 2 |Add them to continuity contact list. |
| 2 → 3 |Include continuity obligations in contracts. |
| 3 → 4 |Run joint recovery drills. |
| 4 → 5 |Establish continuous resilience scorecard. |

# Enablers
- **People:** Procurement, BCM Lead, Vendor Owner  
- **Process:** Identify → Engage → Test  
- **Technology:** TPRM tool, continuity tracker  

# Evidence
- Supplier list with contact info  
- Contract continuity clauses  
- Joint test results  

# KPIs
- Number of critical vendors included in continuity plans  
- Frequency of supplier recovery tests  
- SLA compliance rate during disruptions  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)
| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tracking | Airtable | Supplier BCP matrix |
| Collaboration | Nextcloud | Document sharing |
| Dashboards | Metabase | Test participation rate |

# Common Pitfalls
- Supplier contact data outdated  
- No testing of vendor response  
- Contract clauses unenforced  

# Compliance Mapping
| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO 22301 | 8.4 / 8.5 |
| ISO 27001 | A.5.19 |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | ID.SC / RS.RP |
| NIRMATA Mapping | BC-Q10 ensures continuity dependencies include suppliers. |
