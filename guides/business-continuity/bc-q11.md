> **Question:** Does the organization monitor key resilience metrics and report them to management?

# Why This Matters
Without metrics, continuity maturity remains subjective. Quantitative indicators help management prioritize investment and oversight.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No resilience metrics defined.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Isolated metrics collected during audits.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Key performance and risk indicators established.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Reports generated quarterly for management review.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Metrics integrated with risk and compliance dashboards.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated resilience scorecard and predictive analytics. </div>
</div>

# How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |List basic resilience indicators (RTO adherence, test completion). |
| 1 → 2 |Define KPIs and KRIs formally. |
| 2 → 3 |Establish reporting cadence and responsibility. |
| 3 → 4 |Integrate with risk dashboards. |
| 4 → 5 |Automate analytics and trend insights. |

# Enablers
- **People:** BCM Lead, Risk Manager, IT DR Owner  
- **Process:** Measure → Report → Improve  
- **Technology:** Dashboard, analytics tool  

# Evidence
- Metric definitions  
- Reports and dashboards  
- Management review minutes  

# KPIs
- RTO adherence rate (%)  
- Number of overdue tests  
- BCM maturity index trend  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)
| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboards | Metabase | BCM performance trends |
| Tracking | Airtable | KPI register |
| Alerts | n8n | Report reminders |

# Common Pitfalls
- Metrics not tied to objectives  
- Reports ignored by leadership  
- Manual updates leading to errors  

# Compliance Mapping
| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO 22301 | 9.1 / 9.3 |
| ISO 27001 | A.9.1 / A.10 |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | GV.MA / RS.MI |
| NIRMATA Mapping | BC-Q11 embeds continuity performance management. |
