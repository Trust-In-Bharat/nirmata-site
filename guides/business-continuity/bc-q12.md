> **Question:** Is the business continuity program periodically reviewed and improved based on metrics, incidents, and audits?

# Why This Matters
Review cycles maintain program relevance and embed resilience as a continuous process rather than a one-time project.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No formal review or improvement cycle.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>BCM reviewed reactively after incidents.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual review schedule established. </div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Metrics and audit findings analyzed systematically. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Cross-functional reviews and external benchmarking. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous maturity tracking with executive dashboards. </div>
