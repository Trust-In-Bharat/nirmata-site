> **Question:** Has the organization defined a compliance program with identified obligations, responsible owners, and review frequency?

# Why This Matters
A structured compliance program transforms scattered tasks into a managed system of accountability. It ensures laws, standards, and contracts are tracked and acted upon.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No compliance register or ownership.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Scattered documentation managed by individuals.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Compliance register established with owners and frequencies.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Periodic reviews and status reports to management.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Compliance linked with risk and audit plans.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous tracking and real-time dashboards for all obligations.</div>
