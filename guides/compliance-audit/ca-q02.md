> **Question:** Does the organization maintain a master list of applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements?

# Why This Matters
Knowing every obligation—from licenses to data-protection laws—ensures proactive rather than reactive compliance.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No catalog of applicable laws or standards.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Awareness depends on individual departments.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Compliance matrix lists laws and responsible functions.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Legal register reviewed semi-annually.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Register linked to risk and policy framework.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated alerts for law changes and impact analysis.</div>
</div>
