> **Question:** Are internal and external audits planned, executed, and tracked to closure?

# Why This Matters
Audits verify implementation and uncover blind spots. Systematic planning and closure tracking ensure findings drive improvement.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No formal audit plan or schedule.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Audits conducted sporadically.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual audit plan with defined scope and responsibility.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Findings tracked to closure with evidence.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Audit outcomes inform risk and training updates.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated audit scheduling and analytics on findings. </div>
</div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1|Document audits performed in the past year.|
|1 → 2|Publish formal audit calendar.|
|2 → 3|Implement CAPA tracking for findings.|
|3 → 4|Review findings in risk committee meetings.|
|4 → 5|Automate reminders and trend dashboards. |

# Enablers
- **People:** Internal Auditor, CISO, Management Rep  
- **Process:** Plan → Execute → Report → CAPA → Verify  
- **Technology:** GRC or audit-tracking system  

# Evidence
- Audit plan and reports  
- CAPA log and closure proof  
- Meeting minutes of management review  

# KPIs
- Number of audits completed per year  
- Percentage of findings closed on time  
- Average closure duration  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tracking | Airtable / Odoo | CAPA and status |
| Scheduling | Google Calendar | Reminders |
| Dashboards | Metabase | Finding analytics |

# Common Pitfalls
- Audit plan approved but not executed  
- Findings repeated year after year  
- No evidence of closure
