> **Question:** Are external certifications and surveillance audits (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2) tracked and renewed on time?

# Why This Matters
External certification demonstrates assurance to customers and regulators. Timely renewals prevent loss of credibility and contract risk.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No record of certifications or expiry dates.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Dates tracked by individual departments.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Central register of certifications and surveillance audits.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Renewal calendar and responsibility matrix in place.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Link certification status to client assurance and risk register.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated reminders and evidence dashboards for auditors and clients.</div>

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Register | Airtable / Odoo | Track certifications |
| Calendar | Google Calendar | Renewal alerts |
| Dashboard | Metabase | Visual status |

# Common Pitfalls
- Expiry dates missed due to staff turnover  
- Certificates not linked to scope statement  
- No evidence of renewal follow-up  

# Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO/IEC 27001 | 9.2 (Audit) / 10.1 (Improvement) |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | GV.MA / GV.OV |
| NIRMATA Mapping | CA-Q07 maintains external assurance continuity. |
