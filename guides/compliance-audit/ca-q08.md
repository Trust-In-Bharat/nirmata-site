> **Question:** Are audit and compliance results integrated with the organization’s risk register and management-review process?

# Why This Matters
Audits reveal risk reality. Integrating findings into the risk register ensures corrective actions influence enterprise decision-making.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>Audit findings filed separately from risk records.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Manual cross-reference between risks and findings.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Audit template includes risk ID column.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Findings reviewed in risk committee meetings.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Automated linkage between audit module and risk register. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Analytics correlate findings, risks, and loss events for predictive insight.</div>
