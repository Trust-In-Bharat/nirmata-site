> **Question:** Are compliance and audit metrics defined, measured, and reported to management?

# Why This Matters
Without measurable indicators, compliance remains a checkbox exercise. Metrics quantify progress, resource needs, and control effectiveness.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No compliance KPIs or dashboards.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Manual counts of audits or findings.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>KPIs and targets established for reviews and closures.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Dashboards generated monthly and reviewed by management.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>KPIs linked to risk tolerance and objectives.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Predictive analytics forecast control failures and trends.</div>
</div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1|Record Number of audits and open findings.|
|1 → 2|Define KPIs for closure rate, timeliness, and risk coverage.|
|2 → 3|Publish dashboard monthly and discuss in governance meetings.|
|3 → 4|Align metrics with enterprise KRIs.|
|4 → 5|Add predictive analytics for compliance forecasting.|

# Enablers
- **People:** Compliance Officer, Risk Manager, CISO  
- **Process:** Define → Collect → Report → Improve  
- **Technology:** BI tool (Grafana / Metabase), GRC database  

# Evidence
- KPI list and target values  
- Monthly dashboard or reports  
- Management review minutes  

# KPIs
- Number of audits completed vs planned  
- Percentage of findings closed within SLA  
- Average compliance score per domain  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboards | Metabase / Grafana | Visualize KPIs |
| Data ETL | n8n | Automate updates |
| Tracking | Airtable | Simple metric registry |

# Common Pitfalls
- KPIs defined but never tracked  
- Reports not shared with management  
- Metrics not tied to risk objectives  

# Compliance Mapping
