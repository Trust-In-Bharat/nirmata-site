> **Question:** Does the organization engage independent assurance or third-party validation of its compliance program?

# Why This Matters
Independent validation enhances credibility and identifies blind spots internal teams may overlook.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No external assurance or peer review.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>External reviews done only for client requests.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Independent audit included in annual plan.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>External assessments cover key compliance domains.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Results inform risk and investment decisions.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous assurance via certified partners and attestations.</div>
