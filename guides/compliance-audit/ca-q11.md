> **Question:** Is there a formal maturity-evaluation or benchmarking process for the compliance and audit function?

# Why This Matters
Periodic maturity assessment helps prioritize improvement and demonstrates progress to management and regulators.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No assessment of compliance function maturity.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Self-evaluation done informally after audits.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Maturity model adopted with criteria (people, process, tech).</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Annual maturity scoring and report to management.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Benchmarks shared across industry or frameworks.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated maturity dashboards and peer comparison. </div>
</div>
