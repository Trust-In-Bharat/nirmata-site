  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual management review scheduled. </div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>CAPA actions and recommendations tracked to closure. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Inputs from risk, training, and legal feeds into review. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Dashboards and AI-driven insights guide program evolution. </div>
