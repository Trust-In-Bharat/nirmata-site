> **Question:** Are endpoint and workload security patches tested before deployment to avoid disruption?

# Why This Matters
Uncontrolled patch rollouts can break critical applications. Testing patches before deployment ensures stability while maintaining security posture.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No testing; patches applied or skipped blindly.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Informal testing on one or two systems.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Staging environment created for key workloads.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Regression testing documented; patch sign-off process. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Automated testing pipelines; CI/CD integration for workloads.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Predictive testing using telemetry and rollback automation. </div>
</div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1|Select representative test endpoints; record observations.|
|1 → 2|Create basic staging VM or container environment.|
|2 → 3|Define regression test checklist and sign-off steps.|
|3 → 4|Automate testing and approval via CI/CD or WSUS rings.|
|4 → 5|Use telemetry to predict patch impact; auto-rollback failed updates.|

# Enablers
- **People:** QA engineer, system owner, change manager.  
- **Process:** Testing checklist, approval workflow, rollback plan.  
- **Technology:** Virtual labs, CI/CD pipelines, patch-testing scripts.

# Evidence
- Testing records and approval forms.  
- Patch impact reports.  
- Rollback logs or version history.

# KPIs
- Percentage of patches tested before production.  
- Number of post-patch incidents.  
- Time between patch release and deployment.

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Test lab|VirtualBox / Proxmox|Local environment for patch testing.|
|Automation|Ansible / Chocolatey|Repeatable deployments.|
|Rollback|Timeshift / System Restore|Snapshot-based recovery. |

# Common Pitfalls
- Testing skipped during emergencies.  
- No rollback documentation.  
- Same credentials used across test and prod.

# Compliance Mapping
