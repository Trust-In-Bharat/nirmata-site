> **Question:** Are board or senior leadership meetings provided with periodic cybersecurity and privacy risk updates?

## Objective — Why This Matters
Leadership visibility drives funding, prioritization, and cross-department cooperation. Regular, concise risk updates make cyber and privacy a business topic, not just an IT issue.

## Maturity Levels (0–5)
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No security/privacy updates ever presented.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Irregular briefings without data or follow-ups.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Quarterly deck template with key risks and actions.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Standard KRIs/KPIs, trend lines, and decisions tracked.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Updates tied to enterprise risk, finance, and internal audit.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Benchmarking shared; risk appetite and investment aligned.</div>
</div>

## How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1 | Book a standing 15-minute slot in leadership review; present top 5 risks. |
|1 → 2 | Define a one-page dashboard (KRIs, incidents, projects, vendor issues). |
|2 → 3 | Track decisions in a log; link to risk register and CAPA tracker. |
|3 → 4 | Integrate with ERM and budget cycles; include audit/compliance status. |
|4 → 5 | Add external benchmarks and assurance results; review risk appetite annually. |

## People / Process / Technology Enablers
- People: CISO/Privacy Lead; Finance partner; Internal Audit rep.
- Process: Quarterly management review SOP; decision/action register.
- Technology: Slide template; shared dashboard; risk register.

## Evidence Required
- Last 2–3 decks; meeting minutes and action items.
- Risk dashboard/KRIs with trends.
- Links to risk register entries closed after reviews.

## Metrics / KPIs
- Number of decisions per quarter; % actions closed on time.
- Δ residual risk vs quarter start.
- Incident MTTR trend presented to leadership.

## Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Dashboards | Google Sheets + Charts | Keep it simple; snapshot monthly. |
|Risk register | Simple spreadsheet | Owner, due date, residual risk, evidence link. |
|Presentation | LibreOffice Impress | Standard deck template. |

## Common Pitfalls
- Slides heavy on tools, light on business impact.
- No follow-through on actions from leadership.
- Hiding bad news; under-reporting close calls.

## Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
|ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | 9.3 (management review) |
|CERT-In 2022 | Governance/oversight expectation |
|NIRMATA Scoring | GL-Q02: evidence = decks + minutes + action closure.
