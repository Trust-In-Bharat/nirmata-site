> **Question:** Is there a formally approved enterprise information security policy reviewed at least annually?

## Objective — Why This Matters
A living, approved policy sets the baseline for controls, reduces audit friction, and clarifies “how we work securely.” For MSMEs, short and precise beats long and unread.

## Maturity Levels (0–5)
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No policy or an outdated draft.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Policy exists but not approved or communicated.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Approved policy; employees can find it; annual review scheduled.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Sub-policies mapped; changes tracked; attestations captured.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Policy tied to risk assessments and audits; metrics reported.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous improvement; versioned and benchmark-aligned.</div>
</div>

## How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 | Publish a 4–6 page policy covering scope, roles, access, monitoring, IR, vendors. |
| 1 → 2 | Get formal approval; record version/date; post in intranet; notify staff. |
| 2 → 3 | Add change log; map to sub-policies (e.g., access, backup, logging); collect annual attestations. |
| 3 → 4 | Link policy to risk/audit findings; set KPIs (review cycle adherence). |
| 4 → 5 | Benchmark against ISO/NIST yearly and update with rationale. |

## People / Process / Technology Enablers
- People: Policy owner; approver; Legal/HR reviewer.
- Process: Policy lifecycle SOP; annual review calendar.
- Technology: Version control (git); e-signature for attestation.

## Evidence Required
- Current approved policy PDF + change log.
- Proof of staff notification and access stats.
- Attestation report (completion %).

## Metrics / KPIs
- Policy review on time (Y/N).
- Attestation completion rate.
- # deviations/exceptions approved.

## Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)
| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Versioning | GitHub | Pull requests = approvals; tags = versions. |
| Attestations | Google Forms | Collect annual “read & understood.” |
| Publishing | GitHub Pages | Public or internal hosting. |

## Common Pitfalls
- Policy written like a textbook; nobody reads it.
- Policy not mapped to procedures/controls.
- No evidence of approval or review cycle.

## Compliance Mapping
| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | 5.2; Annex A mapping |
| DPDP Act 2023 | Sec 9 duty alignment |
| NIRMATA Scoring | GL-Q03 requires approved policy + annual review proof.
