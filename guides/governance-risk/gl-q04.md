> **Question:** Does executive leadership allocate dedicated budget and staffing for cybersecurity and data protection initiatives?

## Objective — Why This Matters
Controls cost money and time. A small, ring-fenced budget and explicit capacity avoids half-built safeguards and failed audits. Treat cyber/privacy like any other core function.

## Maturity Levels (0–5)
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No budget; security funded from ad hoc expenses.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>One-off spend for tools or audits without plan.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual line items for minimum controls and training.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Risk-based plan with owners, milestones, and KPIs.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Budget tied to risk reduction and compliance outcomes.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Portfolio managed; ROI tracked; re-prioritized quarterly.</div>
</div>

## How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1 | Create a one-page “minimum viable security” shopping list (EDR, backups, MFA, training). |
|1 → 2 | Add line items to annual budget; assign FTE/part-time capacity. |
|2 → 3 | Build a risk-based roadmap with quarterly milestones and success criteria. |
|3 → 4 | Track benefit metrics (incident reduction, audit closure) in reviews. |
|4 → 5 | Introduce ROI/OKR style measures and adjust quarterly. |

## People / Process / Technology Enablers
- People: Exec sponsor; budget owner; project manager.
- Process: Annual planning; quarterly review.
- Technology: Simple PM tool; KPI dashboard.

## Evidence Required
- Approved budget sheet (redacted ok).
- Security roadmap; staffing plan.
- Review minutes showing funding decisions.

## Metrics / KPIs
- % funded initiatives delivered on time.
- Δ incident rate and audit findings vs last year.
- % budget consumed vs plan.

## Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Roadmap | GitHub Projects | Kanban with milestones. |
|KPIs | Google Looker Studio | Pulls from Sheets. |
|Time/capacity | Toggl Track (free tier) | Time allocation for the function. |

## Common Pitfalls
- Buying tools without people/time to operate.
- No linkage between spend and risk outcomes.
- Starving foundational basics (MFA, backup, logging).

## Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
|ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | 7.1-7.3 (resources/competence) |
|NIRMATA Scoring | GL-Q04 expects documented budget + staffing evidence.
