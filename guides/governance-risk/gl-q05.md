> **Question:** Are key security and privacy roles (CISO, DPO, Risk Officer) appointed with written mandates and independence?

## Objective — Why This Matters
Named, empowered roles avoid conflicts and speed decisions, especially for incidents and regulator interactions. Independence protects objectivity.

## Maturity Levels (0–5)
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No formal role owners.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>People “wear the hat” informally.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Appointment letters and ToR exist; reporting lines clear.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Mandates include decision authority and escalation.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Independence safeguards (no conflicting KPIs); periodic board access.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Succession and backup roles defined; performance linked to outcomes.</div>
</div>

## How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1 | Nominate role owners and draft ToR with duties. |
|1 → 2 | Issue appointment letters; publish org chart with reporting. |
|2 → 3 | Define decision rights and escalation time limits. |
|3 → 4 | Document independence (no product P&L conflicts); board access policy. |
|4 → 5 | Create deputies; set outcome KPIs (e.g., audit closure time). |

## People / Process / Technology Enablers
- People: CISO (part-time acceptable), Privacy/DPO, Risk lead.
- Process: ToR templates; conflict-of-interest statement.
- Technology: HRIS role records; org chart tool.

## Evidence Required
- Appointment letters/ToR.
- Updated org chart with lines of reporting.
- Conflict-of-interest/independence note.

## Metrics / KPIs
- Number of escalations resolved within SLA.
- % policies owned and reviewed on time.
- Audit finding age (by role).

## Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Org charts | draw.io | Simple export to PDF/PNG. |
|ToR templates | Markdown repo | Versioned in git. |
|Role visibility | Intranet page | Who to contact, when, how. |

## Common Pitfalls
- Combining security with conflicting delivery KPIs.
- Roles named but no authority/time.
- No backups; decisions stall during leave.

## Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
|ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | 5.3 roles/responsibilities |
|DPDP Act 2023 | Sec 10(1) DPO/lead |
|NIRMATA Scoring | GL-Q05 expects formal mandate + independence proof.
