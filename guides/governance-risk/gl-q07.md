> **Question:** Does leadership communicate a “tone at the top” emphasizing ethics, compliance, and trust in digital operations?

## Objective — Why This Matters
People mirror leaders. Regular, plain-language messages normalize secure behavior and speed culture change.

## Maturity Levels (0–5)
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No visible leadership messages.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Occasional mails without follow-through.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Quarterly notes in plan; simple themes.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Town-halls; stories from incidents; Q&A.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Leaders review KPIs publicly; celebrate improvements.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Two-way feedback loop; survey-driven themes.</div>
</div>

## How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1 | CEO sends a short note endorsing policy and reporting channels. |
|1 → 2 | Publish quarterly calendar of leadership comms. |
|2 → 3 | Add live town-hall slot with simple demos (MFA, phishing report). |
|3 → 4 | Share metrics; recognize champions/teams. |
|4 → 5 | Run pulse surveys; adjust messages to address gaps. |

## People / Process / Technology Enablers

- Town-hall slides/recording.
- Survey results and actions.

## Metrics / KPIs
- Message cadence adherence.
- Audience reach/read rate.
- Survey sentiment on “leadership prioritizes security”.

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Newsletters | Buttondown / MailerLite | Track opens/clicks. |
