> **Question:** Has the organization established a governing body or committee overseeing cybersecurity and privacy programmes?

## Objective — Why This Matters
A cross-functional committee unblocks decisions across IT, Legal, HR, Ops, and Finance, and provides continuity when people change.

## Maturity Levels (0–5)
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No committee.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Group meets informally.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Charter + quorum; monthly cycle.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Agenda, minutes, action tracker.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Links to ERM, internal audit, budget.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Effectiveness KPIs; annual review of charter. </div>
</div>

## How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 | Identify members; draft charter and objectives. |
| 1 → 2 | Approve charter; schedule standing meetings. |
| 2 → 3 | Maintain agenda/minutes; track actions in a shared board. |
| 3 → 4 | Integrate risk, audit, and budget reviews. |
| 4 → 5 | Publish KPIs; refresh membership annually. |

## People / Process / Technology Enablers
- People: Chair, secretary, function reps.
- Process: Agenda template; action register.
- Technology: Calendar with recurring invite; shared board.

## Evidence Required
- Charter; membership list.
- Last 3 minutes; action log with closures.

## Metrics / KPIs
- Attendance %; actions closed vs opened.
- Time to decision for escalations.
- # policy exceptions approved.

## Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)
| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Minutes | Markdown in repo | PR = approval. |
| Actions | GitHub Projects | Kanban per meeting. |
| Calendar | Google Calendar | Recurring with agenda link. |

## Common Pitfalls
- Committee exists only on paper.
- No quorum; decisions deferred.
- Minutes not stored/versioned.

## Compliance Mapping
| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | 5.3, 9.3 |
| NIRMATA Scoring | GL-Q09 requires active committee with evidence.
