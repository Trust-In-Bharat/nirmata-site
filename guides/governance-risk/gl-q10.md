> **Question:** Are third-party risk and compliance updates presented to leadership periodically?

## Objective — Why This Matters
Most breaches involve suppliers. Leadership needs regular visibility to vendor risk and actions to cut exposure.

## Maturity Levels (0–5)
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No vendor risk reporting.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Only on big incidents.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Quarterly list of critical vendors + risk ratings.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Trends, open findings, expiring assurances.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Contractual remedies and re-classification decisions. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous monitoring and joint exercises reported. </div>
</div>

## How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1 | Build a spreadsheet of high-risk vendors with owners. |
|1 → 2 | Add risk score, last review date, next action. |
|2 → 3 | Include assurance evidence (certs, SOC2), open issues and due dates. |
|3 → 4 | Track contract clauses/breach reporting; escalate overdue vendors. |
|4 → 5 | Integrate continuous monitoring feed and drill results. |

## People / Process / Technology Enablers
- People: Vendor owners; procurement; legal.
- Process: Quarterly TPRM review.
- Technology: Register (sheet/TPRM tool); dashboard.

## Evidence Required
- Latest vendor risk register.
- Leadership deck section; actions from reviews.
- Assurance evidence store.

## Metrics / KPIs
- % high-risk vendors with current assurance.
- Number of overdue vendor actions.
- Time to remediate critical findings.

## Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Register | Spreadsheet | Keep it tight; filterable. |
|Evidence | Drive/Repo | Folder per vendor. |
|Monitoring | RSS/Google Alerts | For public incidents. |

## Common Pitfalls
- “Set and forget” after onboarding.
- No owner for each vendor.
- Missing sub-processor visibility.

## Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
|ISO 27036 / ISO 27701 | Vendor governance |
|DPDP | Sec 8 duties of processors |
|NIRMATA Scoring | GL-Q10 expects periodic leadership reporting + actions.
