> **Question:** Is there a formal link between governance reporting and the organization’s internal audit or assurance function?

## Objective — Why This Matters
Audit closes the loop: controls verified, issues tracked, and lessons learned feed policy and design.

## Maturity Levels (0–5)
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No engagement with internal audit.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Audit requests handled reactively.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual audit plan includes cyber/privacy topics.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Findings tracked to closure; status reported to committee.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Risk-based scoping; remediation verified; trend reporting. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Combined assurance model across 3 lines of defense. </div>
</div>

## How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1 | Nominate audit liaison; share key policies and risk register. |
|1 → 2 | Add cyber/privacy topics to audit calendar. |
|2 → 3 | Use a central CAPA tracker; monthly status to committee. |
|3 → 4 | Add root-cause analysis and control owner coaching. |
|4 → 5 | Map combined assurance across lines (Ops, Risk, Audit). |

## People / Process / Technology Enablers
- People: Audit lead; control owners.
- Process: CAPA governance; monthly reviews.
- Technology: Issue tracker; evidence repository.

## Evidence Required
- Audit plan and last report.
- CAPA list with due dates/owners.
- Closure evidence for last 3 findings.

## Metrics / KPIs
- Average age of open findings.
- % findings closed on time.
- Repeat finding rate.

## Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|CAPA tracker | Spreadsheet/Issues | Aging, SLA, owner columns. |
|Evidence | Repo folders | “Finding-ID/…” with closure docs. |
|Reports | Markdown + PDF | Lightweight templates. |

## Common Pitfalls
- Findings tracked in email only.
- Fixes applied but no proof captured.
- No re-test/verification step.

## Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
|ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | 9.2 internal audit, 10.1 improvement |
|NIRMATA Scoring | GL-Q11 needs CAPA linkage + governance reporting.
