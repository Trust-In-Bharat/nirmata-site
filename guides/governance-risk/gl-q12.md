> **Question:** Does leadership participate in external benchmarking, national frameworks, or sectoral cyber maturity programmes (e.g., NIRMATA, CERT-In)?

## Objective — Why This Matters
External benchmarks prevent local optimism bias and show where to invest next. They also build credibility with customers and regulators.

## Maturity Levels (0–5)
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No participation.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>One-off assessments with no follow-up.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual self-assessment against a framework (NIRMATA, ISO/NIST).</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Targets set from results; actions in roadmap.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Peer benchmarking and independent validation. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Public attestation/certification; improvements tracked year-on-year.</div>
</div>

## How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1 | Choose a framework; run a baseline self-assessment. |
|1 → 2 | Publish results internally; add actions to security roadmap. |
|2 → 3 | Repeat annually; compare deltas; assign owners. |
|3 → 4 | Obtain third-party review; join sector forums. |
|4 → 5 | Share maturity summary with customers; celebrate improvements. |

## People / Process / Technology Enablers
- People: Security/Privacy lead; leadership sponsor.
- Process: Annual assessment calendar; result review.
- Technology: Spreadsheet + charts; portal for evidence.

## Evidence Required
- Assessment report(s) and year-on-year comparison.
- Action plan derived from results.
- Proof of external participation/validation.

## Metrics / KPIs
- Δ maturity score (pillar and composite).
- % actions completed from prior cycle.
- Number of external benchmarks completed.

## Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Self-assessment | Google Sheets | Mirror Annex G anchors. |
|Evidence | Repo/Drive | Map evidence links to questions. |
|Visualization | Radar chart in Sheets | Pillar deltas over years. |

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating assessment as a marketing badge only.
- Chasing certifications without fixing basics.
- No action tracking from results.

## Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
|ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | 9.1 monitoring & measurement |
|CERT-In / Sector Programmes | Participation evidence |
|NIRMATA Scoring | GL-Q12: external benchmark + action linkage required.
