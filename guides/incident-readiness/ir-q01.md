> **Question:** Has the organization defined an incident-response policy and roles approved by leadership?

# Why This Matters
Without a formal policy, response efforts are uncoordinated and slow. Defined authority, scope, and roles ensure decisions happen quickly during crises.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No documented policy; ad-hoc reactions.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Informal roles; unclear authority.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Policy approved; IR Team chartered.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Roles trained; communication matrix in place.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Policy linked to risk & BCP; tested annually.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous review and alignment to new threats.</div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1|Appoint an incident lead; record contact list.|
|1 → 2|Write and approve IR policy with scope & authority.|
|2 → 3|Train members; publish contact matrix.|
|3 → 4|Align IR policy with risk & continuity plans.|
|4 → 5|Review quarterly; benchmark with peers. |

# Enablers
- **People:** CISO / IR Manager / Legal / Comms.  
- **Process:** Policy creation, review, testing.  
- **Technology:** Document portal, alerting channels (Slack, Teams).

# Evidence
- Signed policy and charter.  
- Role descriptions & org chart.  
- Proof of training/acknowledgment.

# KPIs
- Policy review frequency.  
- % of staff aware of IR roles.  
- Time to acknowledge incident notification.

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Policy storage|Git / Wiki|Versioned change history.|
|Alerting|Slack / Rocket.Chat|Team notifications.|
|Contact list|Google Sheets / Nextcloud|Simple shared matrix.|

# Common Pitfalls
- Policy exists but never tested.  
- Roles unclear in off-hours.  
- No integration with BCP or risk register.
