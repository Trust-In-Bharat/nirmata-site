> **Question:** Has the organization conducted incident-response drills or tabletop exercises to validate readiness?

# Why This Matters
Practice reveals gaps that policies hide. Drills build confidence, reduce panic, and shorten response time when real crises occur.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No testing performed.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Unstructured discussion after major events.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual tabletop exercise scheduled. </div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Realistic scenarios; lessons logged and tracked. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Joint exercises with partners and vendors. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous simulation and red-team validation. </div>
</div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1|Discuss past incidents informally.|
|1 → 2|Plan and run basic tabletop with core team.|
|2 → 3|Record findings and assign CAPAs.|
|3 → 4|Invite vendors/clients to joint exercise.|
|4 → 5|Adopt continuous red-/purple-team program. |

# Enablers
- **People:** IR Manager, Risk Officer, Comms Lead.  
- **Process:** Annual exercise plan, CAPA tracking.  
- **Technology:** Drill simulation platform / checklist app.

# Evidence
- Drill agenda & attendance.  
- Lessons learned register.  
- Closed CAPA log.

# KPIs
- Number of drills per year.  
- Findings closed within 90 days.  
- Average response time improvement per cycle.

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Simulation|Tabletop Toolkit / custom scripts|Offline drills.|
|CAPA tracking|Airtable / Odoo Community|Follow-ups.|
|Recording|Obsidian / Markdown|Evidence journal.|

# Common Pitfalls
- Drills become checkbox activities.  
- No follow-up on findings.  
- Scenarios unrealistic.
