> **Question:** Are post-incident reviews and lessons learned integrated into risk, training, and control updates?

# Why This Matters
Post-mortems transform failures into improvements. Capturing lessons and feeding them into risk and training cycles strengthens resilience.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No post-incident review. </div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Discussions held but not documented. </div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Template for lessons learned created. </div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Reviews completed for all major incidents. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Findings update risk register, policies, training. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Analytics track recurrence and learning effectiveness. </div>
</div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1|Hold a team retrospective after each major incident.|
|1 → 2|Create template to capture what worked/failed.|
|2 → 3|Require completion within 7 days of closure.|
|3 → 4|Feed findings into risk register and training plan.|
|4 → 5|Automate metrics on recurrence and closure time. |

# Enablers
- **People:** IR Manager, Risk Officer, Training Lead  
- **Process:** RCA → Lessons → Risk Update → Awareness  
- **Technology:** GRC system, LMS, dashboard  

# Evidence
- Post-incident review reports  
- Updated risk register entries  
- Training records linked to findings  

# KPIs
- % incidents with review completed  
- Number of controls updated post-review  
- Recurrence rate of similar incidents  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Review template|Wiki / Forms|Simple record|
|Risk tracking|Odoo / Airtable|Integrate updates|
|Training LMS|Moodle / Google Classroom|Awareness refreshers|

# Common Pitfalls
- Lessons recorded but never acted on  
- No link to training plans  
- Same issue recurs every quarter
