> **Question:** Is there a continual-improvement program for incident readiness that integrates audit, risk, and awareness outcomes?

# Why This Matters
A living IR program evolves with threats and lessons. Continual improvement links audits, risks, and culture to maintain readiness maturity.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No review or improvement cycle.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Reactive updates after incidents only.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual readiness review performed.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Improvement plan approved and tracked.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>IR findings feed audit, risk, and training plans.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated maturity metrics and external benchmarking.</div>
</div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1|Document issues identified post-incident.|
|1 → 2|Schedule annual IR maturity assessment.|
|2 → 3|Track action plan in GRC or spreadsheet.|
|3 → 4|Integrate outputs with risk and awareness programs.|
|4 → 5|Publish automated maturity dashboards quarterly. |

# Enablers
- **People:** CISO, IR Lead, Internal Audit Head  
- **Process:** Annual review → CAPA plan → tracking → reporting  
- **Technology:** GRC tool, metrics dashboard  

# Evidence
- Readiness review reports  
- CAPA register and closure records  
- Updated training or policy materials  

# KPIs
- Number of improvement actions closed  
- Percentage of controls re-tested after update  
- Maturity score trend quarter-on-quarter  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Tracking|Airtable / Odoo Community|CAPA management|
|Dashboards|Grafana / Metabase|Maturity trend charts|
|Benchmarking|ISO / NIST CSF Excel tools|Compare readiness levels|

# Common Pitfalls
- Improvements logged but not implemented  
- Audit findings not linked to IR plans  
- No quantitative progress tracking  

# Compliance Mapping
