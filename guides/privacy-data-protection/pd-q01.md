> **Question:** Has the organization appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) or designated privacy lead with defined accountability?

# Why This Matters
Clear accountability is the cornerstone of compliance. A named DPO or privacy lead ensures ownership for interpreting laws, coordinating responses, and guiding privacy by design.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No DPO or privacy contact identified.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Responsibilities informally assigned within IT or Legal.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>DPO formally appointed; role documented and announced.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>DPO maintains register, policies, and incident oversight.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>DPO involved in product / project reviews and risk boards.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Privacy office drives enterprise-wide accountability metrics.</div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 | Identify privacy contact and define basic duties. |
| 1 → 2 | Formally appoint DPO; publish announcement internally. |
| 2 → 3 | Create privacy charter and annual plan. |
| 3 → 4 | Involve DPO in change-management and audits. |
| 4 → 5 | Track KPIs and maturity dashboards enterprise-wide. |

# Enablers
- **People:** DPO / Privacy Lead / Legal Counsel  
- **Process:** Charter approval → reporting → annual review  
- **Technology:** GRC or policy portal, communication channels  

# Evidence
- Appointment letter / board resolution  
- Privacy charter and role description  
- DPO contact listed on website or notice  

# KPIs
- Time to respond to privacy queries  
- Number of projects reviewed by DPO  
- Percentage of policies approved by DPO  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Policy hosting | GitHub Wiki / MkDocs | Simple charter publishing |
| Tracking | Airtable / Odoo Community | Privacy register |
| Awareness | Google Forms / LMS | DPO intro training |

# Common Pitfalls
- DPO appointed but no authority  
- Role hidden within Legal or IT
