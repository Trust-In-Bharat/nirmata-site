> **Question:** Has a personal-data inventory or processing register been established and maintained?

# Why This Matters
Organizations cannot protect what they don’t know they hold. A processing register clarifies data flows, legal bases, and risk exposures.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No inventory of personal data assets.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Partial lists maintained by IT or HR.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Central register documented with owners and purposes.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Data flows mapped; legal bases and retention defined.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Inventory linked to risk and security controls. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Dynamic discovery and automated updates via scans. </div>
</div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 | List systems storing personal data (Excel OK initially). |
| 1 → 2 | Create central register with owner and purpose. |
| 2 → 3 | Add lawful basis, retention, and sharing partners. |
| 3 → 4 | Link records to risk register and control matrix. |
| 4 → 5 | Automate discovery using DLP or data-classification tools. |

# Enablers
- **People:** DPO, System Owners, IT Security Lead  
- **Process:** Data-mapping → register review → annual attestation  
- **Technology:** Spreadsheets, GRC tool, data-scan utilities  

# Evidence
- Latest register version  
- Review approval logs  
- System owner sign-offs  

# KPIs
- Percentage of systems mapped  
- Number of updates since last review  
- Time to add new system to register  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Register | Airtable / Google Sheets | Central inventory |
| Mapping | draw.io / Gliffy | Visual data flows |
| Discovery | OpenDLP / DataCurator | Scan structured sources |

# Common Pitfalls
- Inventory never reviewed or approved  
- No linkage to risk or security controls  
- Updates only after audit  

# Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
