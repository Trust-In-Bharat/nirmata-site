> **Question:** Are lawful bases and purposes of processing documented and approved for all personal-data activities?

# Why This Matters
Explicitly recording lawful bases (consent, contract, legitimate interest) provides defensibility and ensures alignment with privacy principles.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No awareness of lawful basis concept. </div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Assumed consent without records. </div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Lawful basis documented per process. </div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>DPO reviews basis changes; training delivered. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Register links basis to purpose and retention. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated validation during project intake. </div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 | Identify core processing activities. |
| 1 → 2 | Document lawful basis for each activity. |
| 2 → 3 | DPO review and approval workflow. |
| 3 → 4 | Link to register and policy repository. |
| 4 → 5 | Integrate checklist into change management. |

# Enablers
- **People:** DPO, Process Owners, Legal  
- **Process:** Review cycle per new activity  
- **Technology:** GRC workflow tool, privacy register  

# Evidence
- Lawful-basis matrix  
- Approval records  
- Training completion reports  

# KPIs
- Number of activities with approved basis  
- Percentage reviewed annually  
- Average approval turnaround time  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow | Google Forms + Sheets | Simple approval log |
| Register | Airtable | Link basis to purpose |
| Awareness | Moodle | Staff training module |

# Common Pitfalls
- “Default consent” for everything  
- No evidence of review  
- Purpose creep between departments  

# Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO/IEC 27701 | 7.2.2 (Lawful basis) |
| DPDP Act 2023 | Sec 5–7 (Lawful purpose and consent) |
| GDPR | Art. 6 |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | ID.DP-02 |
| NIRMATA Mapping | PD-Q03 establishes processing legitimacy. |
