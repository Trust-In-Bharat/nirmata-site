> **Question:** Are procedures in place to manage data-subject rights (access, correction, deletion, portability, objection)?

# Why This Matters
Responding efficiently to data-subject requests demonstrates accountability and avoids penalties under DPDP and GDPR.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No process for rights requests.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Email-based handling; no tracking.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>SOP documented with timelines and approval matrix.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Central register and acknowledgment workflow. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Identity verification and system integration automated. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Self-service portal with analytics on SLA compliance. </div>
</div>
