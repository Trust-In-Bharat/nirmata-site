> **Question:** Is there a continual-improvement and audit cycle for privacy and data-protection maturity?

# Why This Matters
Regular review ensures the privacy program adapts to new laws, technologies, and organizational changes.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No privacy audit or improvement activity.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Reviews conducted only after incidents.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual privacy audit scheduled with scope and checklist.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Findings tracked with CAPA plan and ownership. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Metrics linked to risk and training improvements. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Automated maturity dashboards and external benchmarking. </div>
</div>

# How to Level Up
