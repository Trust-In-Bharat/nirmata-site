> **Question:** Is there a documented process for evaluating the impact of new or updated regulations (DPDP, CERT-In, sectoral)?

## Objective — Why This Matters
Regulatory change can create new liabilities overnight. A structured impact-assessment process ensures new laws or guidelines are tracked, analysed, and implemented before they become compliance gaps or penalties.

## Maturity Levels (0–5)
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No monitoring or structured evaluation of new regulations.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Awareness through news or peers; no documented assessment.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Formal procedure to log and assign new regulations for review.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Impact assessments documented with action plans and owners.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Changes trigger workflow updates and control re-mapping.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous legal monitoring with automated alerts and dashboards.</div>
</div>

## How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1 | Nominate a compliance contact to track new laws from MeitY/CERT-In sites. |
|1 → 2 | Draft a regulatory-change SOP with intake form and assignment matrix. |
|2 → 3 | Maintain a log of each update, analysis, and remedial action; review quarterly. |
|3 → 4 | Link change assessments to policy updates and risk register. |
|4 → 5 | Subscribe to automated feeds; integrate with compliance register dashboards. |

## People / Process / Technology Enablers
- People: Compliance Officer, Legal Advisor, Process Owners.
- Process: Regulatory watch, impact analysis, remediation workflow.
- Technology: RSS/alert feeds, register database, task tracker.

## Evidence Required
- Change-impact log with owner and status.
- Sample analysis reports and corresponding control updates.
- Proof of subscriptions or monitoring channels.

## Metrics / KPIs
- Avg days from regulation release to assessment completion.
- Number of pending updates without owner.
- % of changes implemented within SLA.

## Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Monitoring | Google Alerts / MeitY RSS | Simple keyword-based alerts. |
|Tracking | Sheets / Trello | Track status and owner. |
|Visualization | Metabase | Trend of updates per quarter. |

## Common Pitfalls
- Discovering requirements only during audits.
- Over-delegating without defined owner.
- Not documenting rationale for “no-impact” decisions.

## Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
|DPDP Rules 2023 | Ongoing updates and notifications. |
|CERT-In 2022 | Timely awareness of new reporting obligations. |
|ISO/IEC 27001 | 5.31, 9.3 (legal and management review). |
|NIST CSF 2.0 | GV-3 (governance of regulatory change). |
|NIRMATA Scoring | RC-Q05 Level ≥ 3 requires logged assessments + tracked actions.
