> **Question:** Is there a compliance monitoring programme that verifies ongoing adherence to internal and external obligations?

## Objective — Why This Matters
Controls drift over time. A monitoring programme ensures obligations are continuously met, evidence remains fresh, and deviations are corrected before audits or incidents expose gaps.

## Maturity Levels (0–5)
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No structured monitoring; point-in-time checks only.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Occasional checks; results not logged or trended.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Compliance calendar with scope, owners, and evidence requirements.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Reviews executed to plan; deviations tracked to closure.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Automated evidence collection where possible; dashboards for leadership.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Risk-driven sampling, continuous controls testing, lessons learned updated into procedures.</div>
</div>

## How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1 | Establish a quarterly checklist of top obligations and the evidence required. |
|1 → 2 | Create a compliance calendar with named owners and due dates. |
|2 → 3 | Track deviations and corrective actions; perform management reviews. |
|3 → 4 | Automate evidence capture (configs/exports); publish dashboards. |
|4 → 5 | Shift to risk-based sampling; periodically recalibrate based on findings.

## People / Process / Technology Enablers
- People: Compliance Lead, Control Owners, Internal Audit.
- Process: Calendar, sampling plan, deviation/CAPA workflow.
- Technology: Evidence repository, task tracker, dashboards.

## Evidence Required
- Compliance calendar and completed checklists for the last cycle.
- Deviation log with owners and closure dates.
- Management review minutes and KPI snapshot.

## Metrics / KPIs
- Percentage of planned checks completed on time.
- Number of deviations by severity.
- Median days to close deviations.

## Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Calendar & tracking | Sheets / Trello | Simple cadence and status. |
|Evidence | GitHub / Drive | Version-controlled evidence packs. |
|Dashboards | Metabase | On-time completion and deviation trend.

## Common Pitfalls
- Evidence kept in personal drives with no version history.
- “Tick-box” exercises without remediation.
- No management visibility.

## Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
|ISO/IEC 27001 | 9.1, 9.2 (monitoring, internal audit). |
|NIST CSF 2.0 | GV-6 (oversight), MEA (measurement). |
|DPDP Act 2023 | Ongoing duties and records of compliance. |
|NIRMATA Scoring | RC-Q10 Level ≥ 3 requires calendar + deviation tracking + review minutes.
