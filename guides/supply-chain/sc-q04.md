> **Question:** Are supplier security assessments performed with evidence review and findings tracked to closure?

# Why This Matters
Paper questionnaires alone are insufficient. Evidence-based assessments validate real control operation and drive measurable improvements with partners.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No structured assessments or evidence review.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Unscoped questionnaires; no follow-up.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Standard assessment packs with evidence requests.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Findings logged with deadlines and owners.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Findings linked to risk register and contract obligations.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous assurance via shared dashboards and attestations.</div>
</div>

# How to Level Up

| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
|0 → 1|Adopt a baseline questionnaire (security + privacy).|
|1 → 2|Request artifacts: policies, test reports, certificates.|
|2 → 3|Create finding log with severity and due dates.|
|3 → 4|Tie findings to contractual CAPA and risk entries.|
|4 → 5|Enable periodic re-testing and automated reminders. |

# Enablers
- **People:** Security Assessor, Vendor Owner, Legal  
- **Process:** Request → Review → Record → Remediate  
- **Technology:** GRC/TPRM tool, evidence vault, workflow engine

# Evidence
- Completed assessments with artifacts  
- Findings/CAPA tracker  
- Re-assessment records

# KPIs
- Number of assessments completed this quarter  
- Percentage of findings closed on time  
- Average time to close critical findings

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)

| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|Assessments|Google Forms + Drive|Request and store artifacts|
|Tracker|Airtable / Odoo|Findings and CAPA workflow|
|Dashboards|Metabase|Aging, closure trend|

# Common Pitfalls
- Accepting certificates without scope review  
- No verification of remediation  
- Assessments not repeated at renewal

# Compliance Mapping
