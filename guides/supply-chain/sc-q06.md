> **Question:** Are suppliers required to report security incidents and cooperate in investigations?

# Why This Matters
Timely breach notification from vendors limits damage and enables coordinated containment with regulators and customers.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No incident reporting clauses or process.</div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Vendors inform only if major impact known.</div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Contract requires breach notification within set timeframe.</div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Standard template for vendor incident reporting and response review.</div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Vendor incidents auto-feed into internal IR workflow.</div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Joint exercises and post-incident lessons shared routinely.</div>
</div>

# How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |Add breach notification clause to new contracts.|
| 1 → 2 |Define template for incident report (SLA, contact, impact).|
| 2 → 3 |Test notification process annually.|
| 3 → 4 |Integrate into incident ticketing system.|
| 4 → 5 |Conduct joint post-mortems and share playbooks.|

# Enablers
- **People:** CISO, Vendor Manager, Incident Response Lead  
- **Process:** Notify → Validate → Contain → Review  
- **Technology:** Ticketing system, portal, communication templates  

# Evidence
- Incident notification forms  
- Response logs and timeline  
- Post-incident report  

# KPIs
- Average time to vendor notification  
- Number of joint IR exercises per year  
- Percentage of vendors tested for notification workflow  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)
| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ticketing | Zammad / Redmine | IR workflow integration |
| Templates | Google Docs | Notification forms |
| Tracking | Airtable | Vendor incident log |

# Common Pitfalls
- Unclear notification timelines (e.g., “promptly”)  
- Contact info outdated in contracts  
- Post-incident findings not shared  

# Compliance Mapping
| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO/IEC 27001 | A.5.23 (Incident management with suppliers) |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | DE.AE / RS.CO |
| DPDP Act 2023 | Sec 8(6) — Breach notification by Processor |
| NIRMATA Mapping | SC-Q06 ensures timely vendor incident reporting. |
