> **Question:** Are systemic or concentration risks (e.g., over-reliance on one supplier or region) assessed and mitigated?

# Why This Matters
Over-dependence creates single points of failure. Diversifying suppliers and regions improves resilience and negotiating power.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No visibility into supplier dependence. </div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Risks noted after issues occur. </div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Dependency metrics (e.g., spend, region) tracked. </div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Alternative suppliers identified for critical services. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Concentration data linked to risk and BCP programs. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Predictive analytics for geopolitical and market risks. </div>
</div>

# How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |List all critical suppliers with country and spend. |
| 1 → 2 |Track dependency metrics in register. |
| 2 → 3 |Identify back-ups for single-source suppliers. |
| 3 → 4 |Integrate data with risk and continuity plans. |
| 4 → 5 |Model geopolitical and market scenarios. |

# Enablers
- **People:** Procurement Lead, Risk Manager, Finance  
- **Process:** Identify → Measure → Diversify → Review  
- **Technology:** Vendor register, risk analytics  

# Evidence
- Dependency report by vendor/region  
- Alternate supplier list  
- Review meeting minutes  

# KPIs
- Number of single-source vendors  
- Spend percentage by top 5 suppliers  
- Regional concentration index  

# Low-Cost / Open-Source Options (MSME)
| Purpose | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Analytics | Metabase | Supplier concentration chart |
| Register | Airtable | Add region and spend fields |
| Tracking | Google Sheets | Pivot summaries |

# Common Pitfalls
- Ignoring geographic and cloud provider concentration  
- No alternatives tested  
- Data not shared with business continuity team  

# Compliance Mapping
| Standard | Clauses / Notes |
|---|---|
| ISO/IEC 27001 | A.5.30 / A.5.19 |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | ID.SC-08 |
| NIRMATA Mapping | SC-Q11 reduces single-point supply-chain risk. |
