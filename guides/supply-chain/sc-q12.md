> **Question:** Is the supply-chain security program periodically reviewed for effectiveness and improvement?

# Why This Matters
Continuous review keeps the TPRM program aligned to evolving risks, regulations, and market conditions.

# Maturity
<div class="levels-grid">
  <div class="level level-0"><strong>0 — Unaware</strong><br>No review or metrics on TPRM performance. </div>
  <div class="level level-1"><strong>1 — Ad Hoc</strong><br>Reviews triggered only after issues. </div>
  <div class="level level-2"><strong>2 — Defined</strong><br>Annual program review scheduled. </div>
  <div class="level level-3"><strong>3 — Managed</strong><br>Metrics and audit results analyzed for improvement. </div>
  <div class="level level-4"><strong>4 — Integrated</strong><br>Feedback from risk, legal, and procurement included. </div>
  <div class="level level-5"><strong>5 — Optimized</strong><br>Continuous assurance and dashboard for program maturity. </div>
</div>

# How to Level Up
| From → To | Actions |
|---|---|
| 0 → 1 |Collect basic feedback from recent assessments. |
