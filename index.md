## The NIRMATA Framework

### Purpose
To provide a **comprehensive maturity reference model** for organizations in India to evaluate their posture across twelve domains of data security, privacy, risk, and AI governance.

### Scope
Applicable to all sectors — starting with **manufacturing**, extendable to services, critical infrastructure, and MSMEs.

### Alignment
- **National Laws:** DPDP Act 2023, CERT-In Directions 2022  
- **International Standards:** ISO 27001:2022, ISO 27701:2019, ISO 42001, NIST CSF 2.0  
- **Philosophy:** Built for *Trust by Design*, *Privacy by Design*, and *Resilience by Default*.

## Maturity Levels

| Level | Label | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **0** | **Non-existent / Unaware** | No formal responsibility or process. |
| **1** | **Initial / Reactive** | Isolated, ad-hoc responses. |
| **2** | **Defined / Emerging** | Policies and roles established, limited adoption. |
| **3** | **Implemented / Managed** | Processes standardized and reviewed. |
| **4** | **Measured / Integrated** | Quantitative control and automation. |
| **5** | **Resilient / Trusted** | Continuous improvement, transparency, and benchmarking. |

## Twelve NIRMATA Domains
1. Governance & Accountability  
2. Risk Management  
3. Compliance Management  
4. Data Lifecycle & Classification  
5. Access & Identity Management  
6. Operational Technology & IoT Security  
7. Vendor & Supply-Chain Governance  
8. Incident Response & Continuity Management  
9. Privacy Operations

## Domain-Level Maturity Indicators
*(Condensed summary; detailed indicators retained from baseline version.)*

Each domain follows the same six-level scale (0-5).  
Examples:

### Governance & Accountability
From no defined roles → to board-level oversight and public transparency.

### Risk Management
From untracked IT issues → to continuous adaptive risk intelligence.

### Privacy Operations
From no policy → to proactive ethical-data-use governance and verified transparency.

### AI Governance
From uncontrolled AI use → to resilient, ethical, and auditable AI oversight integrated with enterprise governance.

*(All twelve detailed level descriptions are preserved from the baseline draft.)*

## TRUST-IN Self-Assessment (Powered by NIRMATA)

Organizations use the **TRUST-IN Self-Assessment Workbook** to:
- Evaluate maturity across the twelve domains.  
- Record evidence and assign confidence levels.  
- Generate a visual **TRUST-IN Maturity Radar**.  
- Identify improvement priorities and plan next-year targets.

The scoring follows the **NIRMATA 0-5 scale** with quantitative weights per domain, as detailed in the workbook section.

---

## Output Artefacts
- **TRUST-IN Certificate of Self-Assessment (CSA):** Issued upon submission with documented evidence.  
- **Maturity Report:** Domain-wise scoring and recommendations.  
- **Resilience Pathway:** Suggested actions to progress from current to target maturity level.

## Next Development Steps
1. Publish **NIRMATA Framework v1.0 Whitepaper**.  
2. Release **TRUST-IN Self-Assessment Toolkit** (Excel + PDF + Online form).  
3. Run **Pilot Cohorts** in manufacturing and IT-services sectors.  
4. Integrate **AI governance modules** as ISO 42001 guidance stabilizes.  
5. Establish **TRUST-IN Benchmark Portal** for voluntary maturity disclosures.  

---

### Closing Statement
**TRUST-IN Bharat** represents a national call to action —  
to move beyond compliance checklists toward measurable, accountable, and resilient digital trust.  

Through the **NIRMATA Framework**, every enterprise — from MSME to conglomerate — can now quantify its maturity, strengthen its defences, and build enduring confidence in India’s digital economy.
