# TRUST-IN Bharat — Framework Positioning and Legal Notice

---

## Positioning Statement

The **TRUST-IN Bharat Framework** is **not a certification standard**, nor is it intended to replace, supersede, or conflict with any existing or emerging certification schemes such as **ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management Systems)**, **ISO/IEC 27701 (Privacy Information Management)**, **ISO/IEC 42001 (Artificial Intelligence Management Systems)**, **SOC 2**, or any framework recognized by the **Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)** or other international accreditation bodies.

Instead, TRUST-IN Bharat functions as an **independent maturity and readiness assessment framework**—a structured, evidence-based tool that helps organizations understand **where they currently stand** in relation to globally accepted standards and **what actions** are necessary to achieve formal certification, should they choose to pursue it.

It enables **progressive, proportional adoption**, particularly for **MSMEs and mid-sized enterprises**, guiding them through a clear, measurable path from **awareness** to **sustained compliance** without the administrative or financial burden typically associated with certification programs.

At its present stage, TRUST-IN Bharat serves as an **advisory and capability-building initiative** designed to **complement** and **support** recognized standards by offering **clarity, structure, and measurable maturity guidance** to Indian organizations.  
If, in the future, the **Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)** or another competent authority reviews and formalizes its methodology, it may evolve into a **nationally recognized certification program** in its own right. Until such formal adoption, its role remains **informative, non-accredited, and supportive**.
